```

1. [2024-10-17T20:18:42.447Z]

This is the timestamp of the log entry in UTC.


2. "- - -"

These dashes typically represent HTTP method, path, and protocol. In this case, they're empty because this is a TCP connection, not HTTP.


3. 0

This is the response code. For TCP connections, it's always 0.


4. - - - "-"

These represent various HTTP-specific fields that are not applicable for TCP connections.


5. 239 242 65

239: Bytes sent from the client to the server
242: Bytes sent from the server to the client
65: Duration of the connection in milliseconds


6. - "-" "-" "-" "-"

More HTTP-specific fields not applicable to TCP.


7. "10.42.1.57:3306"

This is the destination address and port (MySQL server).


8. outbound|3306||mysql.cosmos.svc.cluster.local

This is the Istio service name for the outbound connection.
It's targeting port 3306 of the mysql.cosmos.svc.cluster.local service.


9. 10.42.0.52:33846

Source IP and port (the node-pub-sub pod).

10. 10.43.181.169:3306

Destination IP and port (MySQL service).

11. 10.42.0.52:45664

The original source IP and port before any NAT.

12. - -

Additional fields that are empty in this case.

---
This log entry shows a successful TCP connection from the node-pub-sub pod (10.42.0.52) to the MySQL service (10.43.181.169:3306). The connection lasted 65 milliseconds, and a small amount of data was exchanged (239 bytes sent, 242 bytes received). This pattern is typical for a database connection being established, possibly for a quick query or a connection test.
The fact that data is exchanged in both directions suggests that not only was the connection established, but some form of communication occurred, which is a good sign for database connectivity.
